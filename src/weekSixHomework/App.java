/*
 * Create an interface named Logger
 * Logger should have two void methods: 
 * 		- log (which takes a String)
 * 		- error (which takes a String)
 * Create two classes that implement the Logger interface, AsterikLogger and SpacedLogger
 * 
 * The log method on the AsterikLogger should print out the string it receives between 3 asteriks on either side of the string.
 * e.g. if it the String argument is "Hello" it should print ***Hello*** to the console.
 * The error method on the AsterikLogger should print the String argument in a box of asteriks and preceeded by the word ERROR
 * e.g.			******************
 * 				***ERROR: Hello***
 * 				******************
 * 
 * The SpacedLogger will add spaces between each character in the String argument passed in.
 * The log method on the SpacedLogger should print the following if the argument were "Hello"
 * H e l l o
 * The error method on the SpacedLogger should print the following if the argument were "Hello"
 * ERROR: H e l l o
 * 
 * Create a class named App that has a main method.
 * In this class instantiate an instance of each of your classes that implement Logger.
 * Test both methods on each instance.
