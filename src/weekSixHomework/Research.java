		 * Research and write about the differences between Abstract Classes and Interfaces.
		 * 
		 * 		An interface is like a contract and have to be used in the way they are written.
		 * 		An interface also only has the signature of the methods and can't do anything; its
		 * 		like a pattern, not a class.
		 * 
		 * 		An Abstract Class cannot be instantiated...meaning you can't make new instances. The point
		 * 		is to function as a base for subclasses. To use them you have to use the extends keyword.
		 * 		You can define the behavior for them unlike interfaces.
		 * 
		 * Research and write about why Unit Testing is important and what benefits it adds.
		 * 		
		 * 		A unit is usually the smallest implementation of some code so it is easier to design (your code becomes
		 * 		more cohesive as you are forced to use each class in testing), execute, and analyze.
		 * 		Unit testing makes for easier and safer ways to refactor code. Some of the benefits for
		 * 		using unit testing is to make the process more agile, improve the quality of the code, and allow
		 * 		for finding the bugs earlier. Unit tests are like guidelines to keep your code on track.
